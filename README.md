 AutoMobile-Data-Analysis-By-Oracale-SQL

  Overview
This project showcases my SQL querying skills by solving real-world automotive dataset problems. The dataset contains various attributes of cars, including their specifications, features, and prices.

This project demonstrates:
- Data querying techniques
- Aggregation and grouping
- Statistical analysis using SQL
- Complex filtering and calculations



 Project Objectives:-
Below are the tasks I performed:

1. Display the entire dataset.
2. Calculate the median highway MPG for each drive wheels type.
3. Find how many cars have both 'gas' fuel type and 'turbo' aspiration.
4. Compute the total curb weight of cars based on body style with length greater than the average.
5. Identify the make with the highest average highway MPG for cars with a compression ratio > 9.
6. Calculate the average price of cars for each fuel type where the number of cylinders > 6.
7. Find the average price of cars for each make.
8. Determine how many cars have city MPG greater than the 90th percentile.
9. Calculate the average length-to-width ratio of cars for each body style.
10. Identify how many cars have a price within one standard deviation of the average price.
11. Determine how many cars have a price higher than the 75th percentile.
12. Select the maker and price range of the safest vehicles.
13. Identify the make of 4WD cars with only 2 doors.
14. Calculate the average horsepower of diesel-type cars.
15. Calculate the average horsepower of gas-type cars with 4 doors.
